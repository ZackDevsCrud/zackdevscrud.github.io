        <h1>Hi Jenna! Welcome to this silly site! YAAAAY!</h1>

        <h2>Jenna is super duper smelly. Why are you smelly? Let us see why!</h2>

        <div>
            <h3>1. You make me smile!</h3>
            <img class="image" src="rescources/images/smiling_cat.gif" alt="">
            <p>Even when I don't want to smile... you make me smile like a dork. Even when we're not in the same room together. Over the phone, looking at the phone... you always make me smile.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>2. You make me laugh!</h3>
            <img class="image" src="rescources/images/laughing_cat.gif" alt="">
            <p>For no reason at all, you make me laugh. Sometimes you're not even doing anything. Sometimes you say or do some of the silliest things.. COUGH MARKERPLIER.. And you make me cackled and giggle.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>3. You comfort me!</h3>
            <img class="image" src="rescources/images/sad_cat.gif" alt="">
            <p>When I'm anxious, nervous, or overwhelmed... you go out of your way to help in some way. If it's from just smiling at me. Or you hold my hand or pinky. Or you give me a hug to let me know that with you I'm ok and super duper safes.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>And so so much more!</h3>
            <p>There are way too many reasons to list here for why you are so smelly. I just hope you know that you mean a lot to me and I appreciate everything you do for me. Even when I make you mad or upset or hurt you... you still give me the chance to make you happy again. You smell super duper much.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>I hate you 3000</h4>
